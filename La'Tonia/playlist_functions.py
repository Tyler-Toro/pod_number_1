TODO (Question 6): define a function called get_playlist_length()
This function should have one parameter called 'playlist'
The function should return an integer value indicating how many songs there are

# solid/same result without adding int fn

# return (int(len(playlist)))
	return (len(playlist))



'''
TODO (BONUS): define a function called play_track()
It should have two parameters
-'playlist' (a list)
# MAKING A PARAM OPTIONAL SIMPLY MEANS SETTING A VALUE TO IT IN THE FUNCTION()
-'track' (an integer) - this should be optional, and by default play track 1

This function should 'play' the song corresponding to the input track #

For example play_track(my_playlist,3) should print out:

'Now playing track 3, Controversy by Prince' 
Assuming that the third track in your playlist 'Controversy' by 'Prince'

This function should ALSO increase the 'plays' value for that song's dictionary by 1
So, if 'Controversy' has 0 plays so far, it should now be increased to 1
