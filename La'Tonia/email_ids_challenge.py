# You run a startup media company called Ripple Media
# It's typical when you hire a new employee in your company, to setup an email id for them

print('Question 1')
employee_name = 'Ash Rahman'

# You have decided the format of the email should be: Ash Rahman -> ash.rahman@ripplemedia.com
# Let's write some code that converts a name into an email id that matches this format
# 1.1 TODO: Let's save the lowercase version of the employee_name in a new variable 'lower_name'
# .lower method changes all string characters to lowercase
lower_name = employee_name.lower()
print(lower_name)
print()

# 1.2 TODO: We want to separate the first name and last name and save it in a variable 'names_list'
# split makes most sense. still, we did something similar using .join so wonder if join method is a solid option
# in this use case split method creates two separate lists from the split string - one list for each name (first v. last) in the string
names_list = lower_name.split(' ')
print(names_list)
print()

# 1.3 TODO: We want to join the first name and last name with a '.' and save it in a variable called 'joined_names'
# join method feels awkward at first because have empty strings - that may or may not fill with a symbol or text etc. - connected to period symbol then parens to finish the method ... and odd that auto fill does not include the parens - we can auto select the method but have to add the parens at the end
# line 28 re-combines the first and last name anchored to a period symbol between them 
joined_names = '.'.join(names_list)
print(joined_names)
print()

# 1.4 TODO: We want to add '@ripplemedia.com' to the end of the string inside joined_names and save it in a variable 'email'
# simpler than thought given just use + symbol to concatenate ... must be way to also achieve result using a for loop
email = joined_names + '@ripplemedia.com'
print(email)
print()

# Congratulations! Your team is expanding. Below is a list of their names:
# now imagine this list has hundreds and thousands of names - the magic is really felt then

# We want to convert all their names into the same format from Question 1
# basically go step by step from what did above and combine into code block below while using a for loop

# 2.1 TODO: Use a "for" loop to go over each name in the names list
# 2.2 TODO: Inside the "for" loop, create the email id by re-using the logic from Question 1 and...
# 2.3 TODO: ..add the email to the emails list
# Iterative print issue fixed at office hours w/Gaurav ... issue was comments and pprint() both inside of the for loop ... need to be outside/left aligned with 'for'

# print(lower_name) ... to check what code is doing at this stage
# print(names_list) ... to check what code is doing at this stage
# print(joined_names) ... to check what code is doing at this stage

# used pretty print for print statement below because returned result is a big block of text/characters
# realize now that for each loop the returned results adds a name to the content ... lol
