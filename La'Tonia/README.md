# **bold text** JUSTICE THROUGH CODE FALL 2021 COHORT

## *italicized text* Brief Confession by Code Hopeful La'Tonia Mertica
---

I am here by the grace of God. As such I give everything I do my all. I will achieve a place in this world where I am not hungry. Am not cold. Am not unsure. Clarity will line my path and align my values with what the world - not only offers, but - delivers to me. Seeming confusion and misalignments of my deeds will be outlined. Clear and accurate. Undeniably as the foundation of my ability and willingness to go forth. Go forth in confidence, and competence, and comfort. Sighting my prize. Claiming my prize. On my terms. Without disappointment. Nor slight against others.

Amen!
