FIRST NAME: La'Tonia Mertica *pronounced luh tone yuh merr treece*
<br />
<br />
Code/Web Dev hasn't come easy to me. I began this code/web dev journey just inside 2021. In a structured, formalized, and supportive environment. Externally presented, that is. The difference matters. Before that, I tried reading and watching and listening. What the experience taught me is I thrive better with an externally structured, formalized, and supportive environment. And to keep reading and watching and listening. Such conditions - my internal in conspiracy with external - invoke accountability, heightened curiosity, and more optimum elements for holistic growth.
<br />
<br />
Still, it has been more sheer determination than talent. More balance between 'I can' and 'I will' - with 'I am.' Regardless, it settles with me. To do. Or not to do. The risk I took - to join the code/tech eco system - was calculated. It is risk that perpetuates day to day. Moment to moment. Choice by choice. Until I come through (whole). Or, lose my way in the middling. There's no going back. Left are two options - one solid. Succeed. Finish. Actualize my code self. That's one. Versus not. The choice is made. When imposter syndrome or base doubt creep, I go to tangible examples of my cap*ability*: 
<br />
<br />
https://www.latoniamertica.dev/nyt-selected-best-sellers-list/ ... *coded key by key from a frumpy-feeling class assignment into a deployed webpage I am proud of. Perfect, nopes. Damn well done, though. Did it require help from a mentor, absolutely. And still, it is no less a reflection of my potential - ability. Bonus Question: Does it make me want to keep going. Yups. I am.*   
<br />
I can do it, this. Be a worthy member of the code/tech eco system. I know. Because I already have done it. I already am part of the eco system. Keeping pace with modules, classwork, independent self study. And my internal mental mantra that there's no denying I love loOoove this sh*t. I'm here. Where I'm supposed to be. On time. In tune. Challenged - but better for it.  
<br />
*Stated Plain:*
I am here by the grace of God. Granting me humility, persistence, faith for what comes next. As such I give everything I do my all. I will achieve a place in this world where I am not hungry. Am not cold. Am not unsure. Clarity will line my path and align my values with what the world - not only offers, but - delivers to me.
<br />
<br />
Seeming confusion and misalignments of my deeds will be outlined. Clear and accurate. Undeniably as the foundation of my ability and willingness to go forth. Go forth in confidence, and competence, and comfort. Sighting my claim. Claiming my sight. On my terms. Without disappointment. Nor slight against others. Perfect imperfection.
<br />
<br />
It's Said. Outloud, enough. Finally.
