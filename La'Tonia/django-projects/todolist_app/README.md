## **TO DO LIST APP**
*enter data in input fields on any of the three pages, and click options to manipulate content*

<br>

#### **NEXT STEP**
- better precision widths between input fields and submits;<br>
- at least delete and possibly more edit capability for notes;<br>
- *never todo* tip outlining voice/release healing philosophy;<br>
- more appeasing color scheme for todo page submits;<br>
- overall enhanced styling throughout the todo list app ...

#### **PRIMARY TODO**
- successfully implement css stylesheet into django app(s)<br>
- fine tune styling in django app(s) with media queries .. .<br>
<br>

###### NOTE: *this todo app may feel overwhelming initially given the clarity of todo phases included. unsettling is not the goal. the goal is to exercise prudent coding skills while reflecting reality of situation within limitations of coding skills. it is a solid effort producing functional results in an elementary yet fun design*
