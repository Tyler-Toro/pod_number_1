just adding a bit about myself
financial freedom is the motivator
more so for the ability to buy back time, its not something we have in abundance
being able to do things that add complexity would give a higher sense of purpose
adding skills, developing skills, nurishing/maintaining relationships and humility are some key tools necessary for this endeavor.
I look forward to maximizing time spent in this class
